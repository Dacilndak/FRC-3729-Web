	Our team began in the fall of 2010, making the transition from Regis Jesuit Space and Aviation Club to Team 3729. Team 3729 received the Rookie All-Star award the 2011 LogoMotion game, which allowed us to travel to St. Louis for the world championships.
	
	In our second year as a team, the number of team members increased to around 15 active members. We placed second in the Rebound Rumble regional competition, and began volunteer work and participation in a number of community events.
	
	Now in our third year as a team, the current number of active members has grown to around 25 students. We continue to meet three to five times a week as we prepare for the Ultimate Ascent competition.

	<h2>FRC-- FIRST Robotics Competition</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
	<h3>About</h3>
Dubbed a varsity Sport for the Mind,™ FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of 25 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design a team “brand,” hone teamwork skills, and build and program a robot to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors. It’s as close to “real world” engineering as a student can get. Professional Mentors volunteer their time and talents to guide each team.<br />

High-school students get to:
<ul>
  <li>Work alongside professional engineers.</li>
  <li>Build and compete with a robot of their own design.</li>
  <li>Learn and use sophisticated hardware and software.</li>
  <li>Develop design, project management, programming, teamwork, and strategic thinking skills.</li>
  <li>Earn a place in the Championship.</li>
  <li>Qualify for over $16 million in college scholarships.</li>
</ul>
