    <h2>Team History</h2>
    Our team began in the fall of 2010, making the transition from Regis Jesuit Space and Aviation Club to Team 3729. Team 3729 received the Rookie All-Star award the 2011 LogoMotion game, which allowed us to travel to St. Louis for the world championships.
    
    In our second year as a team, the number of team members increased to around 15 active members. We placed second in the Rebound Rumble regional competition, and began volunteer work and participation in a number of community events.
    
    Now in our third year as a team, the current number of active members has grown to around 25 students. We continue to meet three to five times a week as we prepare for the Ultimate Ascent competition.
