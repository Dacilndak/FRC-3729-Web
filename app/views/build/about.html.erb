<p class="text"><h3>What we do</h3>Teach the skills required to build anything in the world today. We start with workshops used to teach safety and skills ranging from tool use to programming. Every skill taught is then used to build the robot during the build season.</p>

<p class="text"><h3>What we use to do it</h3>Every tool imaginable. We use the tools provided to us by FIRST Mark Mahoney, but if he is short something, we go to Accudyne, a machine shop. Mr. Kenner has access to tools ranging from lathes to welding equipment.</p>

<p class="text"><h3>What we use to do it</h3>Anything that could be used in the robot. We use many parts from many sources in our final robot. In the offseason, we experiment with other parts that we may or may not use in the seasons to come. </p>
