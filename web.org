* Structure

** Users
We'll have to have a system of users and logging in for who has access 
to our team's private stuff, like the calenders, who can write on the blog, 
etc. 

We could eventually make this pretty complicated, representing the actual 
structure of our team, like leadership positions, team membership, and even 
our voting for decisions or leaders. But let's stick with the basics first. 

The following should be plenty for now
- Name
- email
- password
- credentials?
  + Whether they can write on the blog, change the calender, change the wiki
    administrate the website, etc. 

** Events
These will be shown by the calendar system
(Right now, either later_dude or Calendarhelper)

We'll need: 
- A name
- A location 
  + We can later maybe have locations and stuff? 
    Helping people find common places we go, e.g. 
    Mahoney's, Regis, DU, etc
- A Date

*** Attendance
Events each get the list of all the users we have,
and we just make a checkbox interface on who is or isn't there.
It's saved as part of the event

And someone will have to have credentials to edit it.


** Blog 
Although eventually we'll want to be able to post videos or files,
I think we keep it simple for now though.

- User who wrote it
- The body of text.

We can work on things like commenting later.
